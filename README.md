### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### My name is Gabe Sharpton and I am a Front End Developer

I love working with Javascript and have found React to be my go to library. While I am trained in Full Stack Development (MVC, MERN, Django), I cant deny my love for Front End Development. I am open to opportunities that allow me to grow my skills as a Jr. Developer.
